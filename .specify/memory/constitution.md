# distributed-surrealdb-example Constitution

## Core Principles

### Code Quality
All code must adhere to high quality standards, including proper error handling, clean architecture, and adherence to best practices for distributed systems and SurrealDB. Code must be reviewed for readability, modularity, and efficiency.

This ensures maintainability and reliability for a POC demo shared in a technical blog.

### Testing Standards
Comprehensive testing is mandatory, including unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests for all components. Tests must cover edge cases and failure scenarios in distributed environments.

This validates functionality, prevents regressions, and builds confidence in the system's behavior.

### Performance Requirements
The system must meet specified performance benchmarks, including latency under 100ms for key operations, throughput of at least 1000 requests per second, and horizontal scalability.

This is critical for distributed applications and demonstrates professional-grade implementation.

### Documentation
All code, APIs, and architecture must be thoroughly documented, including inline comments, comprehensive READMEs, API documentation, and architectural diagrams. Documentation must be accurate and up-to-date.

This is essential for sharing with professionals, enabling reuse, and facilitating contributions.

## Governance
<!-- Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan -->

Amendments to this constitution require consensus from all project contributors. Proposed changes must be discussed and approved before implementation.

All PRs/reviews must verify compliance; Complexity must be justified.
