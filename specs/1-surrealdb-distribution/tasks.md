# Tasks: SurrealDB Distribution POC

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/1-surrealdb-distribution/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are MANDATORY per constitution - include comprehensive unit, integration, and performance tests for all components.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by development phase to enable incremental implementation and testing.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Phase] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Phase]**: Development phase this task belongs to (e.g., PH1, PH2, PH3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- Repository root: `src/`, `tests/`
- Docker files: `src/docker-compose.yml`
- Scripts: `src/scripts/`
- Schemas: `src/schemas/`
- Tests: `tests/integration/`, `tests/performance/`

## Phase 1: Local Docker Compose POC Setup (PH1)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Connect & Test (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion
- **Multi-Instance Writes (Phase 3)**: Depends on Phase 2
- **Third Node & Load (Phase 4)**: Depends on Phase 3
- **Schema & Permissions (Phase 5)**: Depends on Phase 2 (can run parallel with Phase 3-4)
- **Metrics & Consistency (Phase 6)**: Depends on Phase 5
- **Bank Transfer (Phase 7)**: Depends on Phase 5-6
- **K6 Suite (Phase 8)**: Depends on Phase 4-7
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all other phases complete

### Within Each Phase

- Configuration and setup tasks first
- Testing tasks integrated throughout
- Documentation tasks last in each phase

### Parallel Opportunities

- All [P] marked tasks can run in parallel within their phase
- Phase 5 can run parallel with Phase 3-4
- Testing tasks in different phases can run independently

---

## Parallel Example: Phase 3

```bash
# Launch write tests in parallel:
Task: "Implement basic data insertion test in tests/integration/test_data_writes.sh"
Task: "Implement cross-instance read verification in tests/integration/test_data_consistency.sh"

# Launch implementation in parallel:
Task: "Create test script for write operations in src/scripts/test-writes.sh"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Phase 1-3 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup Docker Compose POC
2. Complete Phase 2: Basic connectivity
3. Complete Phase 3: Multi-instance writes
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test data consistency across instances
5. Deploy/demo basic distributed functionality

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Connect (Phase 1-2) → Basic cluster working
2. Add Writes (Phase 3) → Data distribution demonstrated
3. Add Load Testing (Phase 4) → Performance validated
4. Add Schema (Phase 5) → Structured data working
5. Add Monitoring (Phase 6) → Observability implemented
6. Add Bank Transfers (Phase 7) → Consistency stressed
7. Add K6 Suite (Phase 8) → Comprehensive testing
8. Polish (Phase 9) → Production-ready

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Dev A**: Infrastructure (Phase 1-2, parts of 4)
2. **Dev B**: Schema & Logic (Phase 5, 7)
3. **Dev C**: Testing & Monitoring (Phase 3-4, 6, 8)
4. Regular integration testing to ensure consistency

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Phase] label maps task to development phase for traceability
- Each phase should be independently testable and demonstrable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD approach)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate phase independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-phase dependencies that break independence
