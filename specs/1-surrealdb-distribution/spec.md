# Feature Specification: SurrealDB Distribution POC

**Feature Branch**: `1-surrealdb-distribution`  
**Created**: 2025-10-30  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I would like to learn SurrealDB by some simple examples. For example, I want to see how the database can be distributed accross multiple instances. Distributed databases can feel like wrangling caffeinated squirrels, so a small, controlled POC on local machine is a perfect playground."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Setup Multiple Instances (Priority: P1)

As a developer learning SurrealDB, I want to easily set up and run multiple SurrealDB instances on my local machine to understand the basics of distributed databases.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation for all distribution learning - without running instances, no examples can be demonstrated.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by checking that two separate SurrealDB processes are running on different ports and responding to basic queries.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a clean local environment, **When** I run the setup script, **Then** two SurrealDB instances start successfully on ports 8000 and 8001
2. **Given** running instances, **When** I query each instance directly, **Then** both return valid responses indicating they are operational

### User Story 2 - Data Distribution Demo (Priority: P2)

As a developer exploring SurrealDB distribution, I want to see how data inserted into one instance can be accessed from another instance to understand data consistency across the distributed setup.

**Why this priority**: Demonstrates the core value of distributed databases - shared data access.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by inserting data in instance A and successfully querying it from instance B.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** two running instances, **When** I insert a record into instance A, **Then** I can immediately query that record from instance B
2. **Given** distributed data, **When** I update a record in instance B, **Then** the change is reflected when querying from instance A

### User Story 3 - Basic CRUD Examples (Priority: P3)

As a developer learning SurrealDB, I want to run simple Create, Read, Update, Delete operations across the distributed instances to see how standard database operations work in a distributed context.

**Why this priority**: Builds on the distribution foundation with practical database operations.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by performing each CRUD operation and verifying results across instances.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** distributed instances, **When** I create records, **Then** they are accessible from any instance
2. **Given** existing distributed records, **When** I read, update, or delete them, **Then** changes are consistent across all instances

### Edge Cases

- What happens when one instance goes down during operation?
- How does the system handle network partitions between instances?
- What if data conflicts occur between instances?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a simple setup script to start 2 SurrealDB instances on localhost with different ports
- **FR-002**: System MUST demonstrate data distribution by allowing data inserted in one instance to be queried from another
- **FR-003**: System MUST include example scripts for basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) that work across distributed instances
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide clear logging to show which instance is handling each operation
- **FR-005**: System MUST include cleanup scripts to stop instances and remove test data

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **User**: Records representing users with name and email
- **Post**: Records representing posts with title, content, and author reference
- **Instance**: Metadata about each running SurrealDB instance (port, status)

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Developer can set up and run distributed SurrealDB instances in under 5 minutes
- **SC-002**: 100% of basic CRUD operations work correctly across distributed instances
- **SC-003**: Data consistency is maintained (insert in A, read from B returns same data)
- **SC-004**: Setup process has clear error messages and troubleshooting guidance

## Performance Requirements *(mandatory per constitution)*

- **PR-001**: Each SurrealDB instance MUST start in under 30 seconds
- **PR-002**: Basic queries across instances MUST complete in under 100ms
- **PR-003**: System MUST handle at least 100 concurrent operations without significant performance degradation
- **PR-004**: Memory usage per instance MUST remain under 200MB during normal operation

## Documentation Requirements *(mandatory per constitution)*

- **DR-001**: README MUST include step-by-step setup instructions with screenshots
- **DR-002**: All scripts MUST have inline comments explaining their purpose and key operations
- **DR-003**: Architecture diagram MUST show how instances are distributed and connected
- **DR-004**: API documentation MUST explain how to interact with each instance programmatically
